Moving in Alignment with Wall Pseudocode

/*
  Assumes that ultrasonic sensors are placed in close to the front and back wheels on the side 
  facing the wall we want to be aligned with, and that this wall will be on the right of the robot
*/

if (front distance == back distance +/- offset value)
  continue to drive forward normally
if (front distance < back distance)
  increase power duty cycle to right wheel so that robot turns left
if (front distance > back distance)
  increase power duty cycle to left wheel so that robot turns right
  
/*
  While this is running, be checking the hall effect sensor to see if it picks up anything

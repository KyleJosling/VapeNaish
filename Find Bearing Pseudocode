Pseudocode to find the Bearing Needed to go Towards the Pyramid Beacon

/*
  Assumes that tesseract has been successfully located and collected, and that the bot is aligned with the wall on the right side to start
*/

if (front ultrasonic reading < minimum turning radius distance)
  initiate back up sequence
  timestamp at this moment
else initiate flag to start spiralling out and take a timestamp

if (backup && current time < timestamp + interval)
  put motors into reverse and back up
if (backup && current time >= timestamp + interval)
  stop motors
  initiate spiralling flag 
  set timestamp to this current moment (not a new timestamp, same one as before)
if (spiralling && IR not found)
  slow spiral out from wall, more power to right than left to turn left
  every [determined interval] increase power drastically to right to tighten spiral but retain oblong shape
if (spiralling && IR not found && current time >= timestamp + interval)
  tight spiral to conserve space, rather than weird oblong one that might start hitting walls
if (spiralling && IR found && front ultrasonic reading < [desired distance from pyramid])
  back up, but do not continue to spiral
if (spiralling && IR found && front ultrasonice reading > [acceptable distance])
  end spiralling sequence
  start driving forward

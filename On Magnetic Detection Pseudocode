Pseudo-code for When the Bot Detects the Tesseract on the Wall

/*
  Assumes that there is a properly hooked up motor for the sweeping arm, and that desired magnetic intensity value has been found
*/

if (sensor value >= [magnetic intensity])
  initiate flag to drive forward to align arm
  take a timestamp at this very moment
  
if (alignment sequence && current time <= timestamp + interval)
  drive forward, may or may not require alignment
  
if (alignment sequence && current time >= timestamp + interval)
  stop robot 
  engage sweeping arm to push tesseract into bucket
  on completion, take another timestamp
  
if (alignment sequence && current time <= 2nd timestamp + interval)
  wait for tesseract to settle
  
if (alignment sequence && current > 2nd timestamp + interval)
  disable alignment sequence flag
  proceed to spiralling out from wall to find IR beacon
